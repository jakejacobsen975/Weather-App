This weather app seamlessly integrates OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data in JSON format, presenting it in a user-friendly RecyclerView for the next five days. Each time item neatly displays weather information, accompanied by corresponding weather icons obtained through Picasso.

Enhancing user experience, the app boasts captivating background animations. Upon clicking the city name, a mesmerizing sunset descends behind the mountain, gradually transitioning the screen to darkness while updating the mountain image to a darker version. Conversely, tapping the screen initiates a sunrise animation, brightening the screen.

To keep users informed, the app sends daily notifications regarding upcoming rain forecasts. A simplified version now displays notifications upon app entry, alerting users if rain is expected. This streamlined approach ensures users stay informed with minimal disruption to their experience.
